            This project aims to investigate the level of engagement that tweets
            spreading misinformation or disinformation about the alleged sale of
            Scarborough Shoal by Noynoy Aquino and Trillanes generate.

              <h3>Motivation</h3>
              <p>
                The motivation for this project is the increasing prevalence of
                misinformation/disinformation on social media platforms such as
                Twitter and its potential negative impact on public discourse
                and decision-making. By studying the engagement patterns of
                false tweets on a specific topic, this project can shed light on
                how misinformation/disinformation spreads on social media and
                how it can be effectively addressed through fact-checking and
                other interventions.

              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>
                The problem in question for this project is to investigate the
                level of engagement that tweets spreading misinformation or
                disinformation regarding the story about Noynoy Aquino and
                Trillanes selling Scarborough Shoal receive on Twitter. The
                project aims to explore the different types of engagements, such
                as likes, replies, retweets, and quote retweets, and how they
                change over time, with a focus on important events such as news
                coverage and the release of fact-checking articles.

              <h3>Solution</h3>
              <p>
                The ultimate goal is to understand how misinformation and
                disinformation spread on social media and how it affects user
                engagement. This information can be helpful for social media
                companies, policymakers, and other stakeholders who are
                concerned about the impact of misinformation/disinformation on
                public opinion and democratic processes.

                      Z-score standardization can be applied to the numerical
                      engagement variables (Likes, Replies, Retweets, Quote
                      Tweets) in the dataset. Here's why it can be useful:

                        Comparison across Variables: Z-score standardization
                        transforms the variables to have zero mean and unit
                        variance, which allows for a fair comparison across
                        different engagement metrics. By standardizing the
                        variables, you remove the influence of different scales
                        and magnitudes, enabling a meaningful comparison of the
                        relative engagement levels between different types of
                        tweets.

                        Hypothesis Testing: Z-score standardization can help in
                        testing the hypotheses. For example, Hypothesis 1
                        suggests that tweets spreading
                        misinformation/disinformation are likely to have more
                        quote retweets and replies than likes and retweets. By
                        standardizing the engagement variables, you can compare
                        the standardized scores and assess whether the
                        difference in engagement levels between these types of
                        tweets is statistically significant.

                        Data Visualization: Standardizing the engagement
                        variables allows you to visualize and interpret the
                        distribution of engagement levels easily. You can plot
                        standardized scores on a common scale, making it easier
                        to identify patterns or outliers in the data.

                        Statistical Analysis: Z-score standardization is useful
                        when applying certain statistical techniques that assume
                        variables are normally distributed and have comparable
                        scales. By standardizing the engagement variables, you
                        can meet these assumptions and enhance the validity of
                        the statistical analysis.

                      category. Additionally, One-Hot Encoding is suitable for

              <h4>Plotting of Heatmap</h4>
              <p style="margin-left: 2%">
                To create a heatmap to analyze the correlation between the
                number of engagements and the presence of fact-checking articles
                over time, you can follow these steps:
              </p>
              <ol style="margin-left: 2%">
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Create a new column in your dataset to indicate the presence
                    of fact-checking articles. For example, you can create a
                    binary column called "fact_checked" that takes the value 1
                    if the tweet was right after the release dates of the fact
                    checking articles, and 0 otherwise.

                <li>
                  <p>
                    Select the relevant columns for your analysis, such as the
                    engagement metrics (Likes, Replies, Retweets, and Quote
                    Tweets), the fact_checked column, and the Date posted
                    column.

                <li>
                  <p>
                    Group the data by date and fact_checked columns and
                    calculate the sum of the engagement metrics for each group.
                    This will give you the total number of engagements for
                    tweets on each day, grouped by whether a fact-checking
                    article was published on the same day.

                    columns and the dates become the rows, with the total number
                    of engagements as the values.

            Hypothesis 1: Tweets spreading misinformation/disinformation
            regarding the story about Noynoy Aquino and Trillanes selling
            Scarborough Shoal are likely to have more quote retweets and replies
            than likes and retweets.
          </h3>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Based on the hypothesis and the structure of the dataset after the
              exploration phase, the appropriate statistical test for
              <strong>hypothesis 1</strong> is a <strong>paired t-test</strong>.
              This is because it is specifically comparing the means of
              <strong>quote retweets and replies</strong> against
              <strong>likes and retweets</strong> within the
              <strong>same group of tweets</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here's a more in-depth explanation of why a paired t-test is
              suitable:
            </p>

            <ul style="margin-left: 25px">
              <li>
                <strong>Paired Observations</strong>: In the hypothesis, you are
                comparing the number of
                <strong>quote retweets and replies</strong> with the number of
                <strong>likes and retweets</strong>. Each tweet in the dataset
                serves as its own control, as you are comparing the engagement
                metrics within the same tweet. This implies paired observations,
                where each tweet has values for both quote retweets/replies and
                likes/retweets.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Dependent Variables</strong>: You are comparing the
                means of <strong>quote retweets and replies</strong> against the
                means of <strong>likes and retweets</strong>. Both quote
                retweets/replies and likes/retweets are continuous variables
                that represent engagement metrics. Therefore, a test that can
                compare the means of continuous dependent variables is
                appropriate.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Research Question</strong>: The hypothesis specifically
                states that
                <strong
                  >quote retweets and replies are expected to be higher than
                  likes and retweets</strong
                >
                in tweets spreading misinformation. The focus is on the
                difference in means between these two sets of variables within
                the same group. A paired test is designed to analyze the
                difference between paired observations and is well-suited to
                address this research question.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              By employing a paired t-test, you can effectively analyze whether
              there is a significant difference in the means of quote retweets
              and replies compared to likes and retweets, thereby addressing
              <strong>hypothesis 1</strong> in your analysis.

                <strong>Step 0: Dataset Preparation</strong>
                <p>
                  It is important to note that prior to this step, we have
                  already completed the data exploration phase, where we
                  thoroughly cleaned and pre-processed our dataset. As a result,
                  there is no immediate need to make further alterations to the
                  dataset, unless absolutely necessary. The dataset is already
                  in a suitable format for the subsequent analysis. But we will
                  still need to import the required libraries and import the
                  dataset to and store it to a pandas dataframe.

                  Compute the differences between the values of quote retweets
                  and replies, and the values of likes and retweets for each
                  tweet. Create a new variable called "Difference" or subtract
                  the values directly.

                <p>
                  Check the assumptions of the paired t-test, such as the
                  normality of the differences, the independence of
                  observations, and the constant variance of the differences,
                  and verify if they hold for the data.

                        Perform a normality test: use the Shapiro-Wilk test to
                        formally assess the normality of the differences. The
                        Shapiro-Wilk test checks the null hypothesis that the
                        data follows a normal distribution. If the p-value is
                        greater than a chosen significance level (e.g., 0.05),
                        you fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that
                        the data is approximately normally distributed.

                        <p>
                          In this case, the p-value is approximately 5.48e-20,
                          which is an extremely small value. Typically, a
                          significance level of 0.05 (or 5%) is used as a
                          threshold for statistical significance. Since the
                          p-value is much smaller than 0.05, it provides strong
                          evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the data
                          is normally distributed.

                        <p>
                          Therefore, based on this analysis, we can conclude
                          that the differences between quote retweets/replies
                          and likes/retweets are not normally distributed in
                          your data which is further solidified by the plots
                          since it shows that the data is a bell curve that is
                          skewed to the right.

                          In this case, the p-value is approximately 3.96e-94,
                          which is an extremely small value. Typically, a
                          significance level of 0.05 (or 5%) is used as a
                          threshold for statistical significance. Since the
                          p-value is much smaller than 0.05, it provides strong
                          evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the
                          variance of the two groups are equal.

                          Therefore, based on this analysis, we can conclude
                          that there is a significant difference in variances
                          between the combined Likes/Replies group and the
                          combined Retweets/Quote Tweets group. Therefore, it
                          suggests that the assumption of constant variance may
                          be violated for the data which is further solidified
                          by the plots since it shows that the points are not
                          randomly scattered around zero.

                    t-test are violated</strong
                  >. Let's try looking into Non-parametric tests, in particular
                  let's look into the Wilcoxon signed-rank test which is
                  commonly used and is suitable for comparing paired
                  observations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here's an <strong>in-depth explanation</strong> of why the
                  Wilcoxon signed-rank test is appropriate for this hypothesis:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Non-parametric test for paired data:</strong> The
                    Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric test
                    specifically designed for paired data. In the hypothesis, we
                    are comparing the quote retweets and replies with the likes
                    and retweets, which are paired observations within each
                    tweet. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test allows us to assess
                    whether there is a systematic difference between these
                    paired variables, without assuming a specific distribution
                    for the data.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Ordinal nature of the outcome variable:</strong>
                    The number of quote retweets and replies, as well as the
                    number of likes and retweets, are quantitative variables.
                    However, they can also be treated as ordinal variables since
                    they represent counts or frequencies. The Wilcoxon
                    signed-rank test does not require a specific distribution
                    assumption for the outcome variable, making it suitable for
                    analyzing the relationship between ordinal outcome variables
                    and categorical predictor variables.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Robustness to violations of assumptions:</strong>
                    The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is robust to violations of
                    assumptions such as normality and constant variance. As
                    we've seen previously, the assumptions of the paired t-test
                    are violated in the data. By using the Wilcoxon signed-rank
                    test, we can obtain reliable results even when the
                    assumptions are not met.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Focus on differences:</strong> The Wilcoxon
                    signed-rank test focuses on the differences between the
                    paired observations rather than the actual values. In the
                    hypothesis, we are interested in whether there is a
                    difference in the number of quote retweets and replies
                    compared to the number of likes and retweets. The Wilcoxon
                    signed-rank test allows us to assess the direction and
                    significance of this difference.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Interpretation of results:</strong> The Wilcoxon
                    signed-rank test provides a test statistic (W) and a
                    p-value. If the p-value is statistically significant, it
                    indicates that there is evidence of a difference between the
                    quote retweets/replies and likes/retweets. The direction of
                    the difference (whether it is greater or smaller) can be
                    determined based on the signed-rank statistic. The effect
                    size can also be estimated using the test statistic.

                <strong>Step 4: Perform the Wilcoxon signed-rank test</strong>
                <p>
                  We use the scipy.stats.wilcoxon() function to perform the
                  Wilcoxon signed-rank test on the differences calculated
                  earlier. This test compares the median of the differences to
                  zero and assesses whether there is a significant difference
                  between the two sets of observations.

                <strong>Step 5: Interpret the results</strong>
                <p>
                  Before we do any interpretation, let us first define the null
                  and alternative hypothesis
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <em>H<sub>0</sub></em
                    >: There is no significant difference between the number of
                    quote retweets and replies, and the number of likes and
                    retweets.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <em>H<sub>a</sub></em
                    >: The number of quote retweets and replies differs
                    significantly from the number of likes and retweets.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Now we interpret the results of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
                  We compare the obtained p-value with a pre-determined
                  significance level (alpha), which is commonly set to 0.05. If
                  the p-value is less than the significance level, we conclude
                  that there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis,
                  indicating a significant difference between the number of
                  quote retweets and replies, and the number of likes and
                  retweets. If the p-value is greater than or equal to the
                  significance level, we do not have enough evidence to reject
                  the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is no significant
                  difference between the two groups.

              <strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Based on the results of the Wilcoxon
              signed-rank test, which provide evidence to
              <strong>reject the null hypothesis</strong>, we can conclude that
              there is a <strong>significant difference</strong> between the
              number of quote retweets and replies, and the number of likes and
              retweets. Specifically, the data suggest that
              <strong>tweets spreading misinformation/disinformation</strong>
              regarding the story about Noynoy Aquino and Trillanes selling
              Scarborough Shoal are
              <strong>likely to have more quote retweets and replies</strong>
              compared to likes and retweets.

            <p>
              Based on the hypothesis and the structure of the dataset, the
              appropriate statistical test for <strong>Hypothesis 2</strong> is
              an <strong>independent samples t-test</strong>. This test is
              suitable for comparing the means of the engagement metric (i.e.,
              number of engagements) between two independent groups: tweets
              before April 25, 2019, and tweets after that date.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here's a more detailed explanation of why an independent samples
              t-test is appropriate for Hypothesis 2:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Independent Groups:</strong> The hypothesis aims to
                compare the number of engagements (i.e., likes, replies,
                retweets, and quote retweets) on tweets before and after the
                release of Rappler's Fact Checking Article on April 25, 2019.
                The tweets before and after this date represent two independent
                groups. The engagements in one group are not related to or
                dependent on the engagements in the other group. Therefore, an
                independent samples t-test is suitable for comparing the means
                between these two independent groups.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Continuous Variables:</strong> The engagement metrics
                (likes, replies, retweets, and quote retweets) are continuous
                variables that can be treated as numerical quantities. An
                independent samples t-test can effectively compare the means of
                these continuous variables between the two groups.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Research Question:</strong> The hypothesis states that
                the number of engagements on tweets spreading
                misinformation/disinformation dropped over time after the
                release of Rappler's Fact Checking Article. The focus is on the
                difference in means between engagements on tweets before and
                after April 25, 2019. An independent samples t-test is
                well-suited for addressing this research question by comparing
                the means of the engagement metrics in the two groups.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              By employing an independent samples t-test, you can effectively
              analyze whether there is a significant difference in the means of
              engagements (likes, replies, retweets, and quote retweets) between
              tweets before and after the release of Rappler's Fact Checking
              Article on April 25, 2019, thus addressing
              <strong>Hypothesis 2</strong> in your analysis.

                          satisfied since engagement metrics like likes,
                          replies, retweets, and quote retweets are indeed
                          continuous variables. Therefore, no specific
                          statistical test is required to assess this

                          engagement metrics in your dataset are indeed
                          numerical and continuous. You can perform some basic
                          checks to confirm this. Here's an example code snippet
                          that demonstrates how to check if the engagement
                          metrics are numeric:

                <strong>Step 1: Selection of a non parametric test</strong>
                <p>
                  While the assumptions of independence, homogeneity of
                  variance, and interval or ratio data are satisfied in this
                  analysis, the assumption of normality is not met for the
                  engagement metrics in both groups. Therefore, the independent
                  samples t-test, which assumes normality, is not appropriate
                  for comparing the engagement metrics between the two groups
                  before and after April 25, 2019. Let's try looking into
                  Non-parametric tests, in particular let's look into the
                  Mann-Whitney U test or permutation test are more suitable
                  alternatives. These tests do not rely on the assumption of
                  normality and can be used to assess the difference between two
                  independent groups based on their ranks or by permutation of
                  the data.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Here's an in-depth explanation of why the Mann-Whitney U test
                  or permutation test are more suitable alternatives when the
                  assumption of normality is not satisfied:
                </p>

                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Mann-Whitney U test:</strong> The Mann-Whitney U
                    test, also known as the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, is a
                    non-parametric test used to compare two independent groups.
                    It does not rely on the assumption of normality and instead
                    compares the ranks of the observations between the two
                    groups. Here's why it is a suitable alternative:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Robust to non-normality: The Mann-Whitney U test does
                        not assume a specific distribution for the data, making
                        it robust to violations of the normality assumption. It
                        focuses on the ordering of the observations rather than
                        their exact values.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Based on medians: The Mann-Whitney U test compares the
                        medians of the two groups. If the distributions of the
                        engagement metrics in the two groups differ, it is
                        likely to result in a significant difference in the
                        medians.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Assumptions: The Mann-Whitney U test assumes that the
                        observations in each group are independent and that the
                        engagement metrics are measured on an ordinal scale or
                        higher.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Interpretation: The test provides a p-value that
                        indicates the likelihood of obtaining the observed
                        difference in medians (or more extreme) by chance alone.
                        If the p-value is below a pre-defined significance
                        level, it suggests a significant difference between the
                        two groups.

                    non-parametric resampling-based test that provides an
                    alternative way to assess the statistical significance of
                    the difference between two groups. Here's why it is a
                    suitable alternative:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        No assumptions about the data distribution: The
                        permutation test does not rely on any assumptions about
                        the data distribution, including normality. It works by
                        randomly permuting the observations between the two
                        groups, recalculating the test statistic, and repeating
                        this process many times to obtain the empirical null
                        distribution.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Flexible and adaptable: The permutation test can be
                        applied to a wide range of data types and study designs,
                        making it a versatile tool for hypothesis testing. It
                        allows for customized test statistics based on your
                        research question and provides a p-value based on the
                        empirical null distribution.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Robustness: The permutation test is robust against
                        violations of assumptions like normality and homogeneity
                        of variance. It provides reliable results even when the
                        data does not meet the assumptions of traditional
                        parametric tests.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Validity: The permutation test provides exact p-values
                        and maintains the desired type I error rate, meaning
                        that the reported p-value is the exact probability of
                        observing a test statistic as extreme as or more extreme
                        than the observed statistic under the null hypothesis.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Interpretation: The p-value obtained from the
                        permutation test represents the likelihood of obtaining
                        the observed test statistic (or a more extreme value)
                        under the null hypothesis. If the p-value is below a
                        pre-defined significance level, it suggests a
                        significant difference between the two groups.

              <strong>CONCLUSION: </strong>Based on the results of both the
              <strong>Mann-Whitney U test</strong> and the
              <strong>permutation test</strong>, which indicate that there is
              <strong>no significant difference</strong> between the two groups,
              we <strong>fail to reject the null hypothesis</strong>.

              <br /><br />Therefore, we
              <strong>do not have sufficient evidence</strong> to conclude that
              the number of engagements (likes, replies, retweets, and quote
              retweets) on tweets spreading misinformation/disinformation
              dropped over time after the release of Rappler's Fact Checking
              Article last April 25, 2019. The data does not support the
              hypothesis that the engagement metrics significantly decreased
              following the article's release.

              <br /><br />It's important to note that failing to find a
              significant difference does not necessarily mean that there is no
              effect. It could be possible that the effect is small or that
              other factors are influencing the engagement metrics. However,
              based on the available data and the statistical tests performed,
              we cannot confidently conclude that there was a significant drop
              in engagements after the article's release.

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Based on objectives, the appropriate machine learning model for
              this project is <strong>event detection</strong>. Event detection
              is a suitable model for analyzing the level of engagement and
              changes over time in tweets spreading misinformation or
              disinformation about the alleged sale of Scarborough Shoal by
              Noynoy Aquino and Trillanes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here's an in-depth explanation of why event detection is the
              appropriate model for this project:
            </p>

            <ol style="margin-left: 35px">
              <li>
                <strong>Analyzing Engagement</strong>: The aim of the project is
                to investigate the level of engagement generated by tweets
                spreading misinformation/disinformation about the alleged sale
                of Scarborough Shoal. Event detection models are designed to
                identify and analyze significant events or occurrences in a
                dataset. In this case, the events of interest are the tweets
                related to misinformation/disinformation. By applying event
                detection techniques, you can identify and study these specific
                events and their associated engagement metrics.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Temporal Analysis</strong>: The research question
                involves understanding how engagement changes over time. Event
                detection models can effectively handle temporal analysis by
                detecting events and their timestamps. By analyzing the events'
                temporal distribution and examining the associated engagement
                metrics, you can gain insights into how engagement varies over
                time in relation to the spread of misinformation/disinformation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Hypothesis Testing</strong>: The project includes two
                hypotheses related to engagement metrics. Event detection models
                can help validate these hypotheses by identifying the events
                (tweets spreading misinformation/disinformation) and comparing
                the engagement metrics (likes, replies, retweets, and quote
                tweets) within these events. By analyzing the event-specific
                engagement patterns, you can assess the support or contradiction
                of the hypotheses.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Dataset Features</strong>: The provided dataset contains
                relevant fields such as "Tweet," "Likes," "Replies," "Retweets,"
                and "Quote Tweets." Event detection models can utilize these
                features to identify and analyze the events of interest. The
                temporal information in the "Date posted" field can also be used
                to perform time-based analysis.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              By employing event detection techniques, you can effectively
              detect and analyze the events related to tweets spreading
              misinformation/disinformation about the alleged sale of
              Scarborough Shoal. This model allows for the examination of
              engagement metrics, temporal analysis, hypothesis testing, and
              utilization of the dataset features, thereby addressing the
              research question and hypotheses in your project.

                <h4>Choosing The Appropriate Time Series Analysis Model</h4>

                <p>
                  <strong>Change Point Detection</strong> is an appropriate
                  model for our project because it is specifically designed to
                  identify significant changes in engagement levels over time.
                  We are interested in analyzing the engagement metrics of
                  tweets spreading misinformation and determining if there are
                  any changes or trends in these metrics.
                </p>

                <p>
                  By utilizing <strong>Change Point Detection</strong>, we can
                  pinpoint specific time points where there is a noticeable
                  shift in engagement patterns. This will enable us to identify
                  any substantial changes in the engagement levels of tweets
                  spreading misinformation, such as sudden increases or
                  decreases in engagement following the release of fact-checking
                  articles. This analysis will be crucial in evaluating our
                  hypotheses and gaining insights into the dynamics of
                  engagement over time.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Although <strong>Peak Finding</strong> and
                  <strong>Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest</strong> have
                  their merits in certain contexts, they may not directly
                  address our project goals of analyzing changes or trends in
                  engagement levels over time.
                  <strong>Peak Finding</strong> primarily focuses on identifying
                  the highest or lowest points in a time series, which may not
                  provide us with a comprehensive understanding of temporal
                  patterns. On the other hand,
                  <strong>Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest</strong> is
                  better suited for detecting unusual or outlier behavior in a
                  time series, which may not align with our specific objective
                  of identifying significant changes or trends.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Considering these factors, we conclude that
                  <strong>Change Point Detection</strong> is the most suitable
                  model among the given options for our project. It will allow
                  us to effectively analyze engagement levels and detect
                  significant changes over time, helping us gain valuable
                  insights into the dynamics of misinformation spread on
                  Twitter.

                <h4>Structure and Mechanism of the Chosen Model</h4>

                <p>
                  <strong>Change Point Detection</strong> is a statistical
                  modeling technique used to identify points or periods in a
                  time series where there is a significant change in the
                  underlying data distribution or behavior. The goal of this
                  model is to detect these change points, which indicate shifts
                  in engagement levels over time in the context of your project.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The structure and mechanism of a Change Point Detection model
                  typically involve the following steps:

                <ol style="margin-left: 35px">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Data Preprocessing</strong>: Prepare the engagement
                    data of tweets spreading misinformation for analysis. This
                    may involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and
                    organizing the data in a suitable time series format.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Statistical Modeling</strong>: Apply a statistical
                    algorithm or method that is designed to detect change
                    points. There are several approaches available, such as
                    Bayesian methods, likelihood-based methods, or
                    non-parametric methods. One commonly used method is the
                    Bayesian Change Point Detection algorithm, which uses
                    Bayesian inference to estimate the likelihood of change
                    points in the time series.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Parameter Selection</strong>: Set appropriate
                    parameters for the model, such as the prior distribution,
                    the number of potential change points, and the sensitivity
                    of the model to detect changes. These parameters will affect
                    the performance and accuracy of the Change Point Detection
                    algorithm.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Change Point Detection</strong>: Apply the chosen
                    statistical algorithm to the engagement time series data.
                    The algorithm will analyze the data and identify time points
                    where significant changes occur in the engagement levels.
                    These change points can represent shifts in user behavior,
                    the impact of external events, or the effectiveness of
                    fact-checking articles.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Visualization and Interpretation</strong>: Once the
                    change points are detected, visualize the results by
                    plotting the engagement time series and indicating the
                    identified change points. This will provide a visual
                    representation of the detected shifts in engagement levels
                    over time. Interpret the detected change points and analyze
                    their implications in relation to your research question and
                    hypotheses.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Validation and Refinement</strong>: Validate the
                    detected change points by comparing them with known events
                    or external factors that could potentially influence
                    engagement levels. Assess the performance of the model and
                    refine the parameters if necessary to improve the accuracy
                    of detecting change points.

                  By following these steps, the Change Point Detection model
                  will help us identify and analyze significant changes in
                  engagement levels over time. It provides a statistical
                  framework to uncover shifts in engagement patterns, allowing
                  us to gain insights into the dynamics of misinformation spread
                  on Twitter and evaluate our research hypotheses.

                    <p>
                      From the results of the Shapiro-Wilk test we know that the
                      dataset is not normally distributed hence we can't use the
                      'normal', and 'l2' cost function for the change point
                      detection algorithm.

                    <p>
                      The results of the linearity test shows that there is
                      linearity between the dependent variable (tweet
                      engagement) and the independent variable (date posted).
                      Hence, we can make use of the 'linear' cost function for
                      the change point detection algorithm.

                      The PELT algorithm will be used to perform the Change
                      Point Detection. The PELT algorithm, short for "Pruned
                      Exact Linear Time," is a change point detection algorithm
                      used to identify points in a time series where the
                      underlying data distribution changes significantly. It is
                      appropriate for datasets with temporal information, such
                      as our dataset with the "Date posted" field.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Change point detection algorithms aim to identify abrupt
                      shifts or transitions in the data. In our case, the PELT
                      algorithm can help detect changes in the engagement of
                      tweets related to the sale of Scarborough Shoal over time.
                      By analyzing the engagement metrics like "Likes,"
                      "Replies," "Retweets," and "Quote Tweets," we can identify
                      periods when the engagement significantly deviates from
                      the overall pattern.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The PELT algorithm is suitable for our dataset because it
                      offers several advantages:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Efficiency: PELT is designed to be computationally
                        efficient and can identify change points in linear time.
                        This efficiency is crucial when dealing with large
                        datasets, especially when analyzing the engagement of
                        tweets over an extended period.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Flexibility: PELT can handle various types of data
                        distributions and is not limited to specific assumptions
                        about the underlying data. It does not assume a specific
                        distribution of engagement metrics, allowing it to adapt
                        to different patterns and changes in your data.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Pruning: PELT incorporates a pruning technique that
                        helps eliminate unnecessary calculations, further
                        enhancing its efficiency. The pruning step allows the
                        algorithm to focus on the most likely change points,
                        reducing computational complexity while maintaining
                        accurate results.

                  Evaluating the model's performance using the appropriate
                  evaluation metrics
                </h4>

                <p>
                  When ground truth information about actual change points is
                  unavailable, evaluating the performance of a change point
                  detection model becomes more challenging. However, there are
                  unsupervised methods that can be adopted to assess the results
                  of the model.
                </p>

                <p>
                  One such method is visual inspection, where the engagement of
                  tweets is plotted over time along with the detected change
                  points. This allows for a qualitative assessment of whether
                  the detected change points align with the expected shifts in
                  engagement. Look for noticeable changes in patterns or trends
                  that coincide with the release of fact-checking articles.
                  While subjective, visual inspection can still provide valuable
                  insights.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Based on what we know about the dataset, the events to be
                  detected by our model would be any changes in the trends of
                  engagements. Upon visually inspecting the model, we are able
                  to see that most of the change points detected are influenced
                  by sudden peaks in engagements, while the rest of the tweets
                  in that timeframe have little to no engagements. The average
                  engagements listed before and after these change points are
                  also low. Also of note is that the difference in engagements
                  before and after the change points is often less than 1.

                    dataset</strong
                  >
                  <br /><br />
                  From our visual inspection of the model, we are able to see
                  that the trends the model attempted to detect are not actually
                  of any significance and cannot be considered a trend in the
                  context of social media engagement. A tweet would need much
                  more than 2 or 3 engagements for it to reflect any sort of
                  reach on a wider audience. While there are a number of tweets
                  that have relatively higher engagement compared to the
                  majority of tweets in our dataset, it is difficult to properly
                  attribute this to a specific factor as these tweets exist as
                  uncommon outliers in our dataset. Therefore, any connection
                  made between these outliers may not be strong enough to have
                  real analytical weight.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong>CONCLUSION:</strong> low volume of engagements has
              affected the entirety of the research as the low amount of
              engagement per tweet has made it near impossible to analyze the
              data according to the structure of the ratio. Even if there are
              tweets in our dataset that have more quote tweets and replies than
              likes and retweets, the scale of engagements would not reflect a
              large enough audience showing positive or negative sentiment
              towards them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though the low amount of engagements on our dataset of
              <strong>mis/disinfo</strong> tweets may reflect an unpopularity of
              the topic on Twitter, it may be important to note that, currently,
              when searching for tweets related to
              <strong>Scarborough Shoal</strong>, the top tweets with at least
              100 likes are unrelated to misinformation or disinformation about
              the topic. This may be significant as it may point to the majority
              of <strong>misinformation/disinformation</strong> tweets regarding
              <strong>Scarborough Shoal</strong> never reaching a significant
              audience, unlike other tweets about it such as news coverage.
              Other topics studying
              <strong>disinformation/misinformation</strong> may be able to take
              note of this in regards to how
              <strong>mis/disinfo</strong> performs on the platform in general.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>FOR FUTURE WORKS:</strong> Based on the problems
              encountered in our research, we would like to attempt the approach
              of
              <strong
                >analyzing tweets under the structure of the ratio once again
                with a more popular topic in order to have a larger scale of
                engagements.</strong
              >
              This in turn would better reflect the general sentiment of an
              audience, which we were unable to find in our dataset.

          <p>
            Our research project is significant because it addresses the growing
            prevalence of misinformation and disinformation on social media
            platforms, specifically Twitter, and the potential consequences for
            public discourse and decision-making. Misinformation and
            disinformation can be highly deceptive, influencing people's
            beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors based on inaccurate or misleading
            information.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our research focuses on social media engagement and its broader
            implications. By examining the level of engagement generated by
            tweets spreading misinformation or disinformation about the alleged
            sale of Scarborough Shoal by Noynoy Aquino and Trillanes, we aim to
            shed light on several crucial aspects:
          </p>

          <ul style="margin-left: 35px">
            <li>
              Understanding the spread of misinformation/disinformation: Through
              analyzing the engagement patterns of false tweets, our research
              will enhance our understanding of how misinformation and
              disinformation propagate on social media. This knowledge is vital
              for identifying the tactics and mechanisms employed by those
              disseminating false information.
            </li>

            <li>
              Assessing the impact of misinformation/disinformation: By
              examining engagement metrics such as likes, replies, retweets, and
              quote retweets, our research can provide insights into the extent
              to which false information captures users' attention and resonates
              with them. This assessment will help us evaluate the influence and
              potential harm caused by misinformation and disinformation on
              social media platforms.
            </li>

            <li>
              Informing interventions and countermeasures: By studying how
              engagement changes over time, particularly following significant
              events like news coverage and the release of fact-checking
              articles, our research can contribute to the identification of
              effective interventions and countermeasures against misinformation
              and disinformation. Understanding how engagement fluctuates in
              response to these events will assist in developing strategies
              aimed at combatting false information and promoting accurate
              content.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The significance of our research goes beyond the specific case study
            of Noynoy Aquino and Trillanes' alleged sale of Scarborough Shoal.
            It offers valuable insights into the broader issue of misinformation
            and disinformation on social media, supporting social media
            companies, policymakers, and other stakeholders in developing
            measures to mitigate negative impacts and safeguard the integrity of
            public opinion and democratic processes.

                      Initially, a paired t-test was considered as the
                      appropriate statistical tool. However, upon assessing the
                      assumptions, it was determined that the dataset did not
                      meet these assumptions.

                  We found that our initial approach of analyzing the tweets
                  based on the phenomenon of ratios on Twitter was unsuccessful
                  due to the low volume of engagements per tweet. While we were
                  unable to execute what we originally intended to do, we found
                  that since the view count feature was not present during the
                  posting of the tweets in our dataset, the low amount of
                  engagement may reflect a lack of audience for these
                  dis/misinformation tweets, minimizing the effect they would
                  have on the PH Twitter user base.

                <li>
                  Our findings, while lacking in some regard, could contribute
                  as significant data about the performance of misinformation
                  and disinformation on Twitter. From here, analysis can be
                  extended to more popular topics and how well
                  misinformation/disinformation tweets about them may perform
                  compared to the tweets regarding Scarborough Shoal, which may
                  not have an audience on Twitter, based on the engagements
                  observed.

                  For users of social media, they may be familiar with how the
                  presence or absence of engagements such as likes and replies
                  can reflect the performance of a post. A large presence in
                  engagements can reflect a lot of positive reactions towards
                  what was shared, and a complete lack of engagement can reflect
                  either a disinterest or lack of reach completely with the
                  content of the post. Ignorance, in a way, is bliss since the
                  misinformation and disinformation contained in these tweets
                  cannot harm the user base of Twitter if they are not seen or
                  considered relevant by Twitter’s algorithm for the majority of
                  Twitter users.

              <strong>What are the potential impacts of your research?</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Our research has a few important potential impacts despite our
                  minimal results. The most important of these is its potential
                  to inspire future researchers to implore a similar approach as
                  this research to a topic more appropriate in terms of studying
                  its level of engagements, or to study a topic under a similar
                  structure (i.e., "the ratio" in Twitter). This is certainly
                  not the first of its kind, but it is one of the few that
                  studies local Philippine issues alongside the Twitter
                  platform. Research about other similar interests such as
                  finding out if the same Twitter ratio culture exists in
                  Facebook Meta, the most popular social media platform in the
                  country, will be an example of what's in the scope of the
                  potential impacts of this research.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Moreover, another potential impact stems from the data
                  collected themselves. Future studies and articles can validly
                  cite this study and say that tweets spreading misinformation
                  and disinformation regarding this issue have low levels of
                  engagements.

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Are there any practical applications?</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Aside from being a possible source material and a potential
                  inspiration and reference for future studies, there is no
                  other practical application for this study. Unfortunately, due
                  to the nature of the topic (i.e., low engagements resulting in
                  little to nothing to work with), there are minimal practical
                  results and much less so practical applications. This,
                  however, does not mean that this study has failed; the study
                  was still fruitful in a sense that it has drawn a positive
                  conclusion despite the difficulties in analyzing the data.
                  This conclusion and the entire process itself is already
                  valuable information for a plethora of people, which makes it
                  a successful study.

                  The bottom line is that this research may have failed in one
                  sense, that is, the analysis of desired data, but has
                  succeeded in spite of its failure–it showed that tweets
                  spreading misinformation and disinformation regarding this
                  topic have little to no engagement, which is an overall
                  positive conclusion not just for this study, but for the
                  people and their country.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  We should make this information available to the public. For
                  researchers, this information will be a potential source, and
                  the study itself can be both inspirational and motivational
                  especially in creating a similar study or in continuing their
                  current studies amidst all difficulties, for a positive
                  conclusion is waiting at the end. For students, teachers, and
                  the academe, this study provides evidence of the low
                  engagements that tweets have regarding this topic, which can
                  be useful when, for example, describing the fake news culture
                  in Philippine social media, particularly on Twitter, by citing
                  this as an example. For the general public, this information
                  is straightforward enough that it might find its place in the
                  general knowledge, making them ever so more aware of the
                  social media culture surrounding them that they take a big
                  part of in their daily lives.

                Hey! I'm Cedric Legara, a 2nd Year student at the University of
                the Philippines Diliman. I'm currently almost halfway through
                the Computer Science program, and I'm thankfully still
                interested and fascinated by algorithms, networks, security, and
                general computers. I love exploring the different ways they can
                be used to solve problems and create new technologies.
                <br />
                But what really motivates me is game and software development.
                I'm really passionate about creating things that people can
                enjoy and use, and I think there's a lot of potential for
                innovation in this area. I've already started working on a few
                projects on my own especially when prompted by events such as
                game jams--I'm really excited to see where they might lead.
                <br />
                Beyond my academic and professional interests, I'm also thinking
                a lot about my place in society. With the rise of artificial
                intelligence and automation, there's a lot of uncertainty about
                what the future of work will look like. Although I know that
                there will always be new opportunities and challenges to
                explore, I'm still worried about this technology and how I will
                fit in this ever-evolving society.

                Hey there! I’m Jayson Tan, a 2nd Year student at the University
                of the Philippines Diliman. I’m currently taking up computer
                science here and I’m excited to learn more about the thing
                that’s been such an integral part of my life since childhood.
                Personally, I really value the preservation of data and media,
                and the pursuit of making them accessible to all people. I
                believe that data should be able to reach the people it needs
                to, regardless of barriers such as disability or income, even
                through means as simple as making it more engaging and easier to
                read.
                <br />
                Outside of this, I’m also really interested in video games and
                game development. In my free time, I love to make pixel art and
                cool off by playing video games. I used to love making things in
                my head, and now I feel like I’m closer to making those ideas
                into reality.
